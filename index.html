			<h1>How is the Internet Infrastructure Connected into Real Life?</h1>
			<br></br>
			<p style="font-size: larger;">In our interconnected world, the sight of networks and internet infrastructure has become a common yet remarkable aspect of 
				modern life. Like hidden arteries coursing beneath the surface or delicately suspended above, cables and wires weave 
				intricate patterns, carrying the digital lifeblood that fuels our daily existence. 
				<br></br>
				From the towering cell towers and 
				antennas that bridge distances wirelessly to the unassuming manholes concealing the secrets of underground connectivity, 
				these visible manifestations of the internet infrastructure remind us of the invisible web that binds us all together. 
				As we navigate our surroundings, the subtle presence of these technologies serves as a visual testament to humanity's 
				insatiable quest for connectivity and the wonders of the digital age.</p>

			<h1>Cables in Wellington</h1>
			<p>Internet connectivity is primarily facilitated through a network of cables that span vast distances both underground 
				and above ground. These cables carry data in the form of electrical signals or light pulses. Fiber-optic cables are 
				increasingly used for their high-speed data transmission capabilities. These cables are often bundled together and 
				laid out across cities and regions, forming the backbone of the internet infrastructure.</p>

				<h3>Cables Bringing a House Internet</h3>
				<p>These above ground cables are the daredevils of connectivity, swinging and dancing in the open air, 
					defying the laws of physics like the rebellious cousin of Spider-Man. While the rest of the world is 
					stuck in the mundane trenches of the earth, these cables are high-fiving birds and squirrels as they 
					stretch from house to house like the neighborhood's very own internet trapeze artists.</p>

				<p>Here, we see a truly horrifying sight. Instead of being in the ground and hiding its ugliness, a slithering 
					cable has decided to peek out and say hello right beside my living quaters. They didn't even have the decency 
					to paint it grey, making it stick out like a dancing chicken in a line of penguins.

				<h3>ETP Box in the Coporate World</h3>
				<p>External termination boxes, also known as external termination points (ETPs) or network interface devices (NIDs), 
					are devices used in telecommunications and internet installations to connect the service provider's network to the 
					customer's premises. They serve as an interface between the external communication lines and the internal wiring 
					within a building or property.</p>

				<h3>ETP Beside a Door</h3>
				<p>These termination boxes are typically installed on the external walls of homes, offices, or other buildings, 
					allowing easy access for technicians and minimizing the need to enter the premises for maintenance or repairs. 
					They are designed to protect the connection points and ensure the smooth flow of communication signals.</p>

				<p>The tricky thing about all of these cabinets and cables is that there are so many around. 
					Any one of them could be for the internet, power, private use, the list could go on!! Which is why 
					I included this photo because hey you never know what type of cabinet the internet is stored in.

				<p>Here is a big cabinet containing all the goods. Great for tourists I assure you.

			<p>These sit above the ground and are usually placed right outside a propertys boundary. 
				They connect to a copper or fibre network from the cabinet to the property boundary. 
				The copper or fibre cables are then connected from the pillar or pedestal to the premise.</p>

				<h3>That Grey Tube Sticking Out</h3>
				<p>Plinths elevate networking equipment and cabinets off the ground, which helps protect them from environmental

			<p>Some of the network is attached to poles in the street, either to support the network along the street or to connect the 
				network from the street to a premise. Some of the poles are owned by internet comanies, and others are owned by local 
				power companies who have an agreement with the internet companies to use them.</p>

			<h1>Manholes in Wellington City</h1>
			<p> In urban areas, internet cables are sometimes routed through underground conduits to protect them from environmental 
				elements and accidental damage. Manholes serve as access points for technicians to access and maintain the underground 
				infrastructure. You can often find manholes on sidewalks or streets, marked with covers that bear the logos of 
				telecommunication companies.</p>
